# Markov Localization

In this unit we learned more about the underlying math behind the general localization problem. This includes:

- Derivation of the Bayes Localization Filter (Markov localization) - One of the most common localization frameworks
- 1D realization of Markov localization filter in C++
- Motion & Observation model
