# Particle Filters

A particle filter is another algorithm used for estimating the state of a system, and in many ways it is the best one because:

- The easiest to program
- Most flexible 

We will program a full particle filter. We have a very primitive robot simulator that uses landmarks as a way of doing measurements and it uses three-dimensional robot coordinates. We also solve the estimation problem in as few as 30 lines of code.
