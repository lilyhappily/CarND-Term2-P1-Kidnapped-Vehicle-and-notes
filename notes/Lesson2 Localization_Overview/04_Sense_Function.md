# Sense Function

```python
#Modify the code below so that the function sense, which 
#takes p and Z as inputs, will output the NON-normalized 
#probability distribution, q, after multiplying the entries 
#in p by pHit or pMiss according to the color in the 
#corresponding cell in world.

p=[0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
world=['green', 'red', 'red', 'green', 'green']
Z = 'red'
pHit = 0.6
pMiss = 0.2

def sense(p, Z):
    q=[]
    for i in range(len(p)):
        hit = (Z == world[i])
        q.append(p[i] * (hit * pHit + (1-hit) * pMiss))
    return q

print sense(p,Z)
```

### Normalized Sense Function

```python
#Modify your code so that it normalizes the output for 
#the function sense. This means that the entries in q 
#should sum to one.

p=[0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
world=['green', 'red', 'red', 'green', 'green']
Z = 'red' # Can also be replaced with green
pHit = 0.6
pMiss = 0.2

def sense(p, Z):
    q=[]
    for i in range(len(p)):
        hit = (Z == world[i])
        q.append(p[i] * (hit * pHit + (1-hit) * pMiss))
    q_sum = sum(q)
    for i in range(len(p)):
        q[i] /= q_sum
    return q

print sense(p,Z)
```

### Multiple Measurements

```python
#Modify the code so that it updates the probability twice
#and gives the posterior distribution after both 
#measurements are incorporated. Make sure that your code 
#allows for any sequence of measurement of any length.

p=[0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
world=['green', 'red', 'red', 'green', 'green']
measurements = ['red', 'green']
pHit = 0.6
pMiss = 0.2

def sense(p, Z):
    q=[]
    for i in range(len(p)):
        hit = (Z == world[i])
        q.append(p[i] * (hit * pHit + (1-hit) * pMiss))
    s = sum(q)
    for i in range(len(q)):
        q[i] = q[i] / s
    return q

# Run sense for every measurement received
for k in range(len(measurements)):
    p = sense(p, measurements[k])

print p
```
