# Coin Flip Quiz

Suppose I flip a fair coin and it comes up tails or heads which each have a 50% chance of occurring. What is the probability o flipping a tails, and then a heads?

1/4

This is an example of total probability because the answer is not simply 1/2 since we have to consider all four possible events that could happen since we are flipping twice rather than just the two events if we were flipping once.
