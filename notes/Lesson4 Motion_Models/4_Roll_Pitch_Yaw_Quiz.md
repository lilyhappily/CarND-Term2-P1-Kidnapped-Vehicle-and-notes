# Roll Pitch Yaw Quiz

As mentioned in the lesson, the yaw is the rotation of the car about the z-axis. The other two possible rotations, around the x-axis and y-axis, are called roll and pitch respectively. My question to you is will you need to calculate all three rotations to localize the car effectively?
